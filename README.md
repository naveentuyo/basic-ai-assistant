# Settings
All settings are in configs.py. Settings such as wake and hot words, personality, voices, and much more are easily accessible. All audio cues easily editable inside the Sounds folder.

# Usage Guide
When speaking to the bot, all responses containing the wake word will be processed. The user can simply say "<wake_word>, where is Mount Everest?", and the bot will respond. To interupt simply say the hot word while the bot is speaking. If the bot has just replied or interupted, the user does not need to say the wake word for a follow-up prompt. After a couple seconds the bot will sleep, and the wake word will be once again be required.
